# ARGToolBox
This project aims to allow solving ARGs to be easier and more fun by gathering most of the tools needed to help solve and decipher most common cyphers used online for ARGs.

This all in one app should be able to decipher most common ciphers, decipher images, and decipher audio spectograms.

## Features

- Decipher common ciphers used in ARGs
- Decode images embedded with hidden messages
- Analyze and decipher audio spectograms

## Usage

1. Select the type of cipher or puzzle you want to solve from the main menu.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions or input the necessary data.
3. View the deciphered output or message.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix.
- Use camelCase for naming variables, functions, and classes.
- Provide descriptive comments and follow the established coding style.
- Each specific decipher should have its own standalone file following the OOP structure.
