# ARGToolBox
This project aims to allow solving ARGs to be easier and more fun by gathering most of the tools needed to help solve and decipher most common cyphers used online for ARGs.

This all in one app should be able to decipher most common ciphers, decipher images, and decipher audio spectograms (some features in development).

## Features

- Decipher common ciphers used in ARGs
- Decode images embedded with hidden messages (in development)
- Analyze and decipher audio spectograms (in development)

## Usage

1. Select the type of cipher or puzzle you want to solve from the main menu. 
2. Follow the on-screen instructions and input the necessary data.
3. View the deciphered output.

## TODO

4. Add more cyphers
5. Add audio spectograms
6. Add image deecoders (with metadata too)

## Note

This project used some references from chatgpt to check code, help resolve errors, and help build the GUI

This app is free for personal and commerical use, but crediting will surely help :)
