# ARGToolBox
This project aims to allow solving ARGs to be easier and more fun by gathering most of the tools needed to help solve and decipher most common cyphers used online for ARGs.

This all in one app should be able to decipher most common ciphers, decipher images, and decipher audio spectograms.


*Code Guidlines:*
1. Create a new branch when adding anything new
2. Always use camelCase when naming vairabls, functions, or classes
3. Always add a brief description of the cipher and comment extensively on each part of the code
4. This project follows OOP which means each specefic decipher should be in a standalone file fore example ceaserCipher.py, base10Cypher.py, etc.
5. GUI can only be made using Tkniter

This app is free for personal and commerical use, but crediting me will surely help :)

Thanks,
Mohamed Amr
